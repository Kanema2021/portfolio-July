GIVEN I need to potential employers to see updated samples of my work 
WHEN I load my portfolio
THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN a drop down menu with links will appear
WHEN I click on one of the dropwdown links 
THEN I am taken to that deployed application or information page
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
